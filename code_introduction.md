For **Feature Engineering** part, check the 

```
preprocess.ipynb
```



First run `preprocess.ipynb` to generate `./train/train_preprocess` and `./test/test_preprocess`,  these files would be used in the next part which is `ml_prediction.ipynb`



For **Learning algorithm** and **Hyperparameter selection and model performances** check the 

```
ml_prediction.ipynb
```



To run the code, just run each cells in these files.
